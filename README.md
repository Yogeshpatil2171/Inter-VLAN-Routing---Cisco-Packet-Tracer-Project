# Inter-VLAN Routing - Cisco Packet Tracer Project

## üìö Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Inter-VLAN Routing** using the **Router on a Stick** method in **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It allows devices in **different VLANs** to communicate using **router subinterfaces**.

## üîß Files in the Repository
| File                    | Description |
|------------------|----------------|
| `basic-intervlan.pkt` | Cisco Packet Tracer file with the full topology. |
| `vlan_config.txt` | All configuration commands applied to the switch and router. |
| `README.md` | Project documentation. |

---

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Open `basic-intervlan.pkt` in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Review `vlan_config.txt` to understand the configurations.
3. Use these commands to verify:
    - `show vlan brief` (on switch)
    - `show ip interface brief` (on router)
4. Test **ping** between devices in **different VLANs** to confirm Inter-VLAN communication is working.
